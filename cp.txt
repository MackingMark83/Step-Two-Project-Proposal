3.What data do you plan on using? You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain. 

I am going to uses the Spoonacular recipe and food API. The kind of data that I will pull from this API is different entries, drink alcoholic and non - alcoholic. Difference types of soups and salad. Also the sides that will be offer with the entries. The user will have to tell you what type of restaurant he or she is opening.

a.What does your database schema look like? 

My schema will have many tables. The first table will be the entries. In this table the table will tell you the name of the entry and what type of meat the entry is what sides go with the meat. The second table will be the sides table. This table will tell you what type of sides the restaurant offers. The third table will be the salads table. The fourth table will be the soups table. This table will tell you what type of soups the restaurant offers. The last table will be the drinks table. This table will tell you what type of drinks the restaurant offers. Their will also be a row in this table that tells you wither a drink is alcoholic and non - alcoholic.    

b. What kinds of issues might you run into with your API? 

The kind of issues I could run in to with this API is maybe a users canâ€™t find the type of food he or she is looking for on the API.
